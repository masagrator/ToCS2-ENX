Translation mod is based on files from official Steam PC and PS4 releases. 
It works fully only with modded Nintendo Switch. Only Atmosphere is supported.
Only game version 1.0.5 is supported.

Main changes:
- Complete translation of game, textures and movies
- Removed completely fixed kernings for better text rendering
- Many custom text tweaks for better readability and blocking text from overflowing
- Added custom menu (press R in title menu to get access). Settings are saved to sd:/config/ToCS2/subsdk9.save. Options:
  - FPS 30 or 60, 
  - changing rendering resolution from 360p up to 1080p,
  - Handheld GPU Boost
- Force enabled Anisotropic Filtering and set it to 16

You can find mod in Releases. Put "atmosphere" folder to root of sdcard. Play game.</br>
It is recommended to enable Handheld GPU Boost for best experience. This recommendation is not related to mod itself, game has optimization issues even without this mod installed. 460 MHz in handheld solves almost all issues with framedrops in 30 FPS mode.

Signs of properly installed mod:
- Title menu descriptions are translated
- Logo in right upper corner is translated
- "Translation mod made by MasaGratoR & Graber" is rendered by plugin in right lower corner.
